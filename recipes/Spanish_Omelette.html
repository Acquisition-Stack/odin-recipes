    <h3>A Quick, Delicious Mediterannean Omelette</h3>
<p>A fully loaded spanish omelette with protein, and addmittedly, some fat. But that's ok as long as you've been good on the other meals that day.</p>
<p>You can enjoy this meal with a salad and rice, or a slice of bread. I've even seen somebody place this in a sandwich for lunch the next day.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chorizo</li>
    <li>5 Eggs mixed</li>
    <li>1 shallot / half an onion</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Pinch of oregano</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cut up the chorizo into small bite-sized chunks.</li>
    <li>Fry the chorizo in a pan with butter or some olive oil.</li>
    <li>There's no need to add garlic because the chorizo already contains garlic. Feel free to add more if you would like. Add the oregano</li>
    <li>Add the onion and fry with the Chorizo.</li>
    <li>Go ahead and add the beaten eggs</li>
    <li>Fry for 3 minutes until done on one side.</li>
    <li>Flip and fry the other side. Use a plate to help if needed</li>
    <li>That's it! Serve and enjoy</li>
</ol>
